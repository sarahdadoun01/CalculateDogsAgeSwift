# Dog Age Calculator

This project is a simple Swift-based application created using **Xcode**. The application allows users to input a dog's age and converts it to its equivalent human age. The conversion is based on a general rule where each year of a dog's life is equivalent to 7 human years. This is just a fun way to estimate the relative age of a dog compared to a human.

## Features
